# BT466-Data-analytics-project
This project is based on the ERIM dataset that includes about 3,000 households in two midwestern cities in the United States. The data contain demographic information such as household incomes, number of household members, education levels of the heads of households, as well as information on the purchases of a number of retail products such as frozen dinners and yogurt. The data were collected between 1985 and 1988 by the marketing research firm, AC Nielsen. Further information can be found here: https://www.chicagobooth.edu/research/kilts/datasets/erim
